You're thinking of creating a real-time collaborative media streaming platform where multiple users can:

✅ Listen to music together (Spotify integration)
✅ Watch YouTube videos together
✅ Chat in real time
✅ Vote to change the song/video
✅ Add video calling for a full social experience

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React (Next.js/Vite), TypeScript
Backend: Node.js (Express/NestJS), WebSockets (Socket.io), Firebase (for real-time sync)
Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase / MongoDB
Streaming APIs: Spotify Web API, YouTube API, WebRTC (for video calling)
Authentication: OAuth (Spotify, Google), Firebase Auth
Hosting: Vercel (Frontend), AWS/DigitalOcean/Heroku (Backend)
⚡ Features Breakdown
🔹 Spotify & YouTube Sync: Users select the platform (Spotify/YouTube) and listen/watch together.
🔹 Real-time Sync: Songs/videos play at the same timestamp for all users.
🔹 Chat & Reactions: Users can send messages, emojis, and reactions.
🔹 Voting System: Majority vote skips or changes the song/video.
🔹 Host Controls: The room creator can lock control or make it democratic.
🔹 Video Calling: Users can enable WebRTC video calls while watching together.
🔹 Party Mode: Random users can join public rooms and vibe together.
